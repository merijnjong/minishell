Basic structure:

input 
    '-> tokenization
			       '-> parsing/error handling
			  				                '-> put into nodes (cmd_list)
											                            '-> execution


Devlin:

Parsing:
		- Lexer: takes the input chars and puts the words into tokens
		- Parser: processes the tokens
		- Absolute and relative paths
		- Also with no path so just "ls"

Merra:

Execution:
		- Execute parsed information
		- Working history, able to navigate with arrow keys
			- Use readline to get what is on the terminal command line and save it. malloced (char **) -> 
				example: if arrow up: put *history[i--] on command line.
		- Implement	pipes						( | )
					redirections				( <, >, >> )
					here-doc					( << )
					double and single quotes	( "", '' )
					environment variable		( $ )
					signals 					( ctrl + c, ctrl + \, ctrl + d )
					built-ins:	- echo -n
								- exit
								- env
								- export
								- unset
								- cd
								- pwd

don't use ft_split!!!
